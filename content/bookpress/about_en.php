<p>IKARUS are a musical organism comprised of Ramón Oliveras (composition and drums), Stefanie Suhner (vocals), Andreas Lareida (vocals), Lucca Fries (piano), and Mo Meyer (bass). The 5 piece is a prism through which influences drawn from Math Metal, Free Jazz, left-field Electronica, modern Pop and Contemporary Classical Music pass through, and create a very distinct sound signature on the output. They call their sound Evocative Jazz – a volatile mixture that emphasizes polyrhythms, minimal grooves, Nordic soundscapes and Prog Jazz deviations. The key ingredient that sets them apart from other contemporary outfits playing around with the Jazz idiom is their use of a wordless, abstracted blend of male and female vocals; as lead instruments and texture. An image to bare in mind while listening to IKARUS is a beautiful tension created between a Nordic darkness and a sweltering, equatorial color palette.</p>
